A few codes taken online such as hidden password, taking data from the results of the previous code, ... have been seen and seemed to be safe üëç

PASSWORD and USER folder you can delete, file remaining is not üêß. Or copy and paste corresponding to the new version to backup personal data

Because 9CMD tool needs to enter password, download in my github will be safe, download elsewhere maybe lose account, not be responsible :v

The Auto function need sent me personal data including id wallet, character address, premium code, stage sweep, AP number for 1 Sweep, World according to the corresponding Stage and ID equipped if have. Overall, it not sensitive information :vv
